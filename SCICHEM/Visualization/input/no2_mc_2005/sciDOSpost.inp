# The keyword PROJECT gives the SCICHEM project (basename)

Project no2-2005-mc

# The keyword CALCulate specifies whether to include background concentrations

calculate plume  ! plume (default) or total = ambient + plume

# The repeatable keyword RECeptors specifies the Receptor Sets to use.
# Files can be the Class I receptor files downloaded from
#   http://www2.nature.nps.gov/air/maps/Receptors/index.cfm
# or contain user-specified receptors, one UTMx,UTMy, or LON,LAT pair per line.
# 2nd word is 1 if the receptor set is Class I, 2 for Class II.
# 3rd word is a user-specified NAME.  The NAME must match the first 4 characters
# in the FLAG (2010) look-up tables for it to be treated as a Class I area, and
# visilbity obscuration calculated.
# 4th word is either LATLON (syn: LL) or anything else for Cartesian
# (including UTM). Must match coordinate system of the SCICHEM run.

# OUTPUT section: 
# 1st word is CONcentration, DEPosition, or VISibility obscuration
# 2nd word is the chemical species to process
# 3rd word is a selection criteria: output ALL values, the MAX value or >VAL
# 4th word is the rank, e.g. the 8th highest high (98th percentile)
# 5th and 6th words specify the period over which to average or take the maximum
# 7th word is either MAX or AVG, the statistic to take over each FREQUENCY
# 8th and 9th words specify the frequency, how often to take the MAX or AVG
# 10th word is the output file type, CSV, XZY (data), or AERMOD-style POSTFILE
# 11th word is the filename, can contain spaces if enclosed in quotes
# 
# All RECeptor sets are written to each output, so XYZ and PLOT/POST files
# should be run with only one REC line above, or you'll get a mashup.
# 
# Visibility obscuration results can only be calculated for Class I
# receptor sets.  They will be silently skipped for other REC sets.
# The FLAG(2010) method probably only makes sense when using CALC PLUME above.
